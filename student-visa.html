								<div class="devider"></div>
								<p class="text alignjustify">
									Studying with International Tourism School Toledo is an unforgettable experience. We do not just deliver high-quality programmes recognised around the world, we also focus on giving you the best student atmosphere possible.
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="inner twelve columns">
							
							<h4 class="title services">Visas and Immigration Information</h4>
							<div class="devider "></div>
							<p class="text alignjustify">
								Most students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland will need a student Visa to study in Spain. Application forms and advice about the Visa process is available from www.exteriores.gob.es. Please note that some countries have different procedures for Visa applications.
							</p>
							<p class="text alignjustify">
								All non-EU (non-exchange) students have to apply for a type-D visa at the Spanish embassy in their home country. The visa is initially valid for three months. Make sure you are granted a type “D” visa with multiple entries. You will then be permitted to travel within the Schengen Area and enter Spain freely during your stay if you travel outside of the Schengen area or return home for holidays. Non-EU student visa holders are normally not allowed to undertake paid work with their type-D visa, unless they obtain a work permit (see below).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="inner twelve columns">
							<h5 class="justify">Documents normally required to process the visa (original and copy):</h5>
							<ul class="discinside text">
								<li class="text alignjustify">Visa application form</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">A valid passport for the duration of the stay (otherwise, your visa will only be awarded until the expiry date of your passport.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Proof of university admission such as an offer letter and details of the contents of your Masters (including the duration).</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Proof of healthcare cover (some embassies/consulates may have a minimum level of insurance).</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Proof of means of support in Spain of not less than €532.51 for each month of the academic year as demonstrated by proof of personal/family resources or guarantee of financial resources or evidence of scholarship award.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">You may have to show a proof of address in Spain.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Two/four passport photos.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Proof of payment of consulate fees (different in each one).
								</p></li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">A medical certificate.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Police background check from your country of residence.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Depending on the consulate, you may be invited for a face-to-face interview.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">The initial processing period is seven days. If you don’t hear back from the consulate, you can assume that all your paperwork is in order and that your visa will be delivered. It will then take a further two months for the visa to be produced.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Once you get notification, you will have to get to the consulate to collect your visa and have it stamped in your passport. If you fail to do so within two months of being notified the visa will be withdrawn. Your visa will be a Schengen visa which allows you to move freely within the Schengen Area.</li>
								<li class="text alignjustify">Within a month of arrival you will have to apply for a non-community student card (please note that tourist visas are not valid when applying for this type of card) from the regional government. This allows you to obtain a longer-term student visa and also to enrol fully at your university. To do this, you must you must go to your local Foreign Nationals Office to make an appointment for fingerprinting to process the foreign national ID card. Bring all the documentation indicated online and payment for the fee (around €15).</li>
							</ul>	
						</div>
						<div class="inner twelve columns">
							<h4 class="justify">Working rights</h4>

							<p class="text alignjustify">
								Non-EU Students with a Type-D visa may apply for a work permit. There are restrictions on the type of work you can undertake and the activities must be compatible with your Masters, for example, teaching, research or work with a subject-related company. The work must be part-time or if it is full-time (for example during holidays), this cannot be for more than three months and must be undertaken outside of teaching time. Your employer has to make the necessary arrangements for your work permit.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="inner twelve columns">
							<h4 class="justify">Healthcare insurance</h4>
							<p class="text alignjustify">
								All non-Spanish students studying at a Spanish university must have adequate medical cover.
							</p>
							<p class="text alignjustify">
								EU students must provide documents which shows their healthcare status in their home country to ensure full access to the Italian system. These documents (charmingly named forms E106/E109/E120/E121/E33/E37) can be requested from your public healthcare organisation back home.
							</p>
							<p class="text alignjustify">
								Non-EU students should check whether there is a reciprocal healthcare agreement between their own country’s healthcare authorities and Spain. If this is the case, students must complete the required procedure with their health department authorities to qualify for free public healthcare in Spain. If there is no agreement between your country and Spain, then you will have to arrange for a private healthcare insurance. As it may be a condition of your visa, you will have to sign up for this type of insurance before your arrival in Spain.

									International students can undertake student work placements in Spain, in addition to studying. They will need to apply for the relevant permit from the Ministry of Employment and Social Security and the specific conditions and documentation required will vary, according to the applicant’s country of residence and the duration of the placement.
								</p>
								<p class="text alignjustify">
									There are several practical issues related to internship and placement you should need to know. It’s very important you are aware about the formalities necessary before leaving such as Visa rules, social security, and arrangements.
